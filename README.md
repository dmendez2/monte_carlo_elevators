# monte_carlo_elevators
Simulates 100 floors of a hotel with an elevator that starts at the ground floor. Randomly determines a number of guests that need to use the elevator. Determines these guest's starting floor and their destination floor. Using Monte Carlo methods, chooses the optimal path so that the elevator takes the shortest path to pick up and drop off all passengers. An annealing algorithm is created to ensure that an absolute minimum and not a relative minimum is chosen. The rules are as follows: 1) The elevator begins on the ground floor 2) Only one guest per floor for both starting and destination 3) Only one guest can ride the elevator at any given time.
